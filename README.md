<h1 align="center">Covid Statistics Algorithms</h1>

### Description
A program to find out `Covid Stats of Different Countries` using `Efficient Algorithms`.

### Algorithms
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).
- Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS).
- Knapsack Algorithm.
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

### Functionalities
- `Top 20 Countries` with the most confirmed cases on a given day.
- `Highest New Cases` between two given dates.
- `Longest Spread Period` for a given country (Used `LIS` for this functionality).
- `Longest Daily Death Toll Decrease Period` for a given country (Used `LDS` for this functionality).
- `Highest Possible Score` attainable for aid (Used `Knapsack` for this functionality).
- `Compare the Response` of any two countries against the virus (Used `LCS` for this functionality).

### Manual
1) You can `Change Covid Data` in the file named as `WHO-COVID-19.csv`.
2) You can `Change Weight of Countries` using in knapsack algorithm in the file named as `CountryWeight.csv`.
